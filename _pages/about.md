I am a first year PhD student trying to discover how the interplay of NLP and robotics can mutually benefit both fields. I am co-advised by Alessandro Roncone as part of the [HIRO](https://hiro-group.ronc.one/) group and by Katharina Kann as part of the [NALA](https://nala-cub.github.io/resources/) group. Prior to CU Boulder, I completed both my bachelors of applied science in computer engineering and my masters of computer science at the University of Toronto under Frank Rudzicz with a focus on NLP. Currently trying to find ther right balance between refreshing 3090 stocks and climbing.

### Research Direction:  

Natural language is the most organic and generalizable way for humans to specify a task, provide new information, and convey intentions. Leveraging language for task specification and skill transfer would greatly increase the ability and transferability of current robots. However, current language models fail to understand language as humans do. Trained solely on text, we hypothesize their lack of real-world experience inherently limits their ability for human-like understanding of language. To this end, we aim at bridging the gap between the field of robotics and NLP to produce robots that can act and learn through language, and who in turn will generate experiences for it develop a richer understanding of language.
